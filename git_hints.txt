# Git hints

## continue work on another feature branch when your work depends on another feature branch being reviewed and awaiting merge
featureA - in review
featureB - created from featureA

When featureA is merged into master or development, here is what you do

1. fetch changes
```
git checkout development
git pull
```
2. rebase featureB branch
```
git checkout featureB
git rebase --onto development featureA featureB
```

3. Now we have a new branch featureB rebased without conflicts and ready to merge with development again
4. in case of changes done to featureA before merging to development, same changes need to be applied to featureB before rebase

## visual git branch graphs
```
git log --graph --oneline --decorate --all
```

show only changes in a line
```
git diff --color-words
```

to narrow output in git diff to one line
+shift+s

## Rename local and remote branch
1. rename local
```
git branch -m old-name new-name
```
2. rename remote
```
git push origin :old-name new-name
```
